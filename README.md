# PRE-REQUISITES
1. ROOT (preferably ROOT 6 or higher)
(https://root.cern.ch/) for download and installation instructions

2. MPICH
(http://www.mpich.org/) for download and installation instructions

# INSTALLATION
The following instruction assumes the user has already build/installed
ROOT and CERN in the machine.
1. Create a new working directory for the project (workdir)

2. In the workdir, open the "setenv.sh" file.

3. Replace "source <path/to/ROOTSYS/bin/thisroot.sh" with the actual path.

4. Put path to MPICH header files in "MPIINCLUDES=" .

5. Put  path to MPICH libraries in "MPILIBS=".

6. Save setenv.sh.

7. In the workdir, do "make".

# USAGE EXAMPLE
An example code (./src/test_tmpi.C) shows the usage of the package

Example to run the macro with 10 parallel process:
In the workdir: "mpirun -np 10 ./bin/test_tmpi". 


# CREDITS:
I would like to thank Taylor Childers for adivising me, HEPCCE (High Energy Physics Center of Computational Excellence) 
program and Argonne National Laboratory for providing the opportunity to work on
